        <h1>My adventure with LTE as failover on OPNsense</h1>
        <p>
            This was the most painful hardware setup I’ve done in a while, but I finally managed to get my Quectel EC25-EUX LTE modem working on my Topton Firewall with OPNsense.
            My journey started on 28 August 2025 and ended on 11 September 2025, because Aliexpress is fast but not fast enough :D.
            <br>
            <b>Summary:</b> To make it work, you need the module and also antennas. The signal must be >10 dBm to have a stable connection. pfSense seems to work better with LTE modems.
        </p>
        <h2>Before You Start</h2>
        <p>
            If you are doing the same thing for your homelab or similar, remember that you need the specific module based on your region (EUX for Europe, EAU for Australia, etc.).
            OPNsense is having a hard time with the PPP protocol. As of now (21 September 2025), we can start a connection with LTE but without achieving good bandwidth.
        </p>

        <h2>Let's Start</h2>
        <p>
            <figure style="margin:0;">
            <figcaption style="margin-bottom:0.5em;">
                Let's start with the hardware installation:
            </figcaption>
            <img src="img/IMG_4643.jpg" 
                alt="Topton N6210 with Quectel EC25-EUX" 
                style="width:100%;max-width:300px;margin:0;">
            </figure>
            <p>
            <figure style="margin:0;">
            <figcaption style="margin-bottom:0.5em;">
            Then, you need to open the Topton case. This is very easy: just remove the 4 screws on the bottom and then use a plastic card to open the case.
            Install the modem in the M.2 slot:
            </figcaption>
            <img src="img/IMG_4646.jpg" 
                alt="Topton N6210 with Quectel EC25-EUX" 
                style="width:100%;max-width:300px;margin:0;">
            </figure>
            Unfortunately, there is no slot for the second screw, so the modem will be a bit loose, but it will work anyway.
            <p>
            For some reason, I thought the modem would work without antennas, but no — it needs them. I’ll talk about this later.
            So, we can turn on the device and start the configuration.
            Booted the PC, OPNsense was OK, so let's go into the /dev/ folder to see if the modem is recognized. Let's execute:
            <pre><code>ls /dev/cua*</code></pre>
            but no cuaU0.* found... Strange, so I decided to check the dmesg:
            <pre><code>dmesg | grep -i "wwan\|qcserial\|cdc\|usb"</code></pre>
            No logs about the modem... What is going on? I decided to check the BIOS settings to see if the M.2 slot was enabled, and it was.
            Something sketchy was going on, so I decided to check the modem again and I noticed something.
            <br>
            <figure style="margin:0;">
            <figcaption style="margin-bottom:0.5em;">
            The modem was having a hard time because it was a little bit bent due to the metal piece near the pins:
            </figcaption>
            <img src="img/IMG_4645.jpg" 
                alt="Quectel Module" 
                style="width:100%;max-width:390px;margin:0;">
            </figure>
            <figure style="margin:0;">
            <img src="img/IMG_4648.jpg" 
                alt="Bent Module" 
                style="width:100%;max-width:300px;margin:0;">
            </figure>
           "It took me 2 hours to figure this out, and I almost returned the modem." :D
            <br>

            So, finally I had something in dmesg and, listing devices in /dev/, I got:
            <pre><code>/dev/cuaU0.0
 /dev/cuaU0.1
 /dev/cuaU0.2    
 /dev/cuaU0.3
 /dev/cuaU0.4</code></pre>
 Now, according to official documentation, usually the one that we need is <b>cuaU0.2</b> or <b>cuaU0.3</b>, so let's try with <b>cuaU0.2</b>:
            <pre><code>cu -l /dev/cuaU0.2</code></pre>
To be totally honest, CU was the worst thing I could use. It was not working properly — and by properly I mean that sometimes I couldn’t see what I typed, or I was not able to exit using ~. As far as I know, the problem was SSH.
Anyway, the first command returned OK: 
<pre><code>AT
 OK
</code></pre> 
then, we have to check if the SIM was recognized:
<pre><code>AT+CPIN?
 ERROR</code></pre> 
 ERROR... ok, so the SIM was not recognized. I tried with another SIM but no luck... You should know that there is a SIM slot on the Topton device I have and, according to what people say online, it communicates with the modem directly through the M.2 slot.
<p>
So, I decided to open the case again and check if the SIM was properly inserted or there was a broken trace on motherboard but, nothing strange found. 
Having lost all hope at this point, I decided to look online and, luckily, I found a <a href="https://forums.servethehome.com/index.php?threads/topton-jasper-lake-quad-i225v-mini-pc-report.36699/">forum post</a> talking about the same device so, I explained the problem there. Someone replied with the solution and it was very easy but not intuitive... Insert the SIM with the cut facing you (you are kidding me, Topton? :D).
<br>
>It worked, we now have the SIM recognized:
<pre><code>AT+CPIN?
 +CPIN: READY
</code></pre>
Now, we can check the signal quality:
<pre><code>AT+CSQ
 +CSQ: 99,99    
</code></pre>
Oh no, the first 99 means that there is no signal. Why? I mean, the module is without antennas but at least I expected like 2–3... 
<br>My mind was going crazy. I was thinking that the module was dead or something like that, so I decided to ask on that forum if someone had the same problem and, luckily, someone answered that without antennas the signal is 99 because the device is a Faraday cage internally.
Let's buy cables + antennas. 
<figure style="margin:0;">
    <img src="img/days.jpg" 
        alt="suffering" 
        style="width:100%;max-width:300px;margin:0;">
</figure>
Antennas + cables arrived and, after connecting the antennas to the modem, I now have the following signal:
<pre><code>AT+CSQ
 +CSQ: 21,99
</code></pre>
Good, now we have signal. 21 is a good value; usually >10 is OK.
Let's check the network registration:
<pre><code>AT+CREG?
 +CREG: 0,1
</code></pre>
1 means that we are registered on the network. 
<br>Now we can check the operator:
<pre><code>AT+COPS?
 +COPS: 0,0,"TIM",2
</code></pre>
TIM is the operator of my SIM so everything is working fine.
<p>
Is time to setup the connection on OPNsense. The procedure is explained in the official documentation <a href="https://docs.opnsense.org/manual/how-tos/cellular.html">here</a>, so I will not repeat it, to spare you some time.
<br>The problem is that, after the configuration, I was not able to establish a connection. This is because FreeBSD (the base of OPNsense) has problems with PPP. The bug ID is <a href="https://bugs.freebsd.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=281218">#281218</a>.
Also, on opnsense-core GitHub there is an issue about this problem <a href="https://github.com/opnsense/src/issues/2142">#2142</a>, and someone was able to get a working connection by using this init string in the PPP configuration:
<pre><code>&F&C1&D2E0S0=0${temp}
</code></pre>
With that string I was able to get a connection, but the bandwidth was very low, around 10 Mbps down and 6 Mbps up but is enough for me for the moment.
<br>
If you need higher speeds, consider using pfSense or a dedicated LTE router.
